| It (health route check) exists but returns JSON in the wrong format. The key should be data, not message                                                                                                                          | I double checked every response to ensure that 'message' is replaced with 'data'.                                               | I checked the response to ensure that data comes out.                                                                                                            |
| When I try to delete, I get a 404 when it should be a 200, and thenthe server crashes.                                                                                                                                            | I replaced the 404 error code with 201 and added a return statement in the case where no data is found to stop server crashing. | I checked to see if the server would still crash by inserting an ID that doesn't exist to see if the error code is correct and if any crashse occur              |
| The POST handler has a code path that returns a 404. A POST route
should never return a 404 because we are creating something for the very first time. 404 is when we cannot find something that wethink has already been created | I removed the 404 completely.                                                                                                   | To ensure it works, I created a listing to make sure there wasn't any problems.                                                                                  |
| The code checks for process.env.PORT, but you need to use the dotenv configure function to actually read this variable from the .env file                                                                                         | I added require('dotenv').config(); to fix this                                                                                 | Inserting different values in .env, and checked the console log to see if the value input is outputted, and did the same with removing it to see if 9000 appears |
| Always return the error message to the client. Do not replace the error message with a generic string like not found or server error                                                                                              | I had the error message print out instead of having a string message                                                            | I purposely gave bad inputs to purposely get errors to assure the error is printed.                                                                              |
